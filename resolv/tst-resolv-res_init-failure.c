/* When res_init is called on a thread whose resolver state has
   already been initialized, it unconditionally invokes
   __res_iclose(&_res, true) before __res_vinit.  __res_iclose used
   to NULL every _u._ext.nsaddrs[ns] without resetting
   _u._ext.nscount, breaking the invariant that
   __res_context_send's validation loop relies on.  If __res_vinit
   then failed (for example, because fopen("/etc/resolv.conf")
   returned EMFILE), the resolver state was left with
   _u._ext.nscount > 0 and _u._ext.nsaddrs[*] == NULL.  The next
   name lookup walked the validation loop and dereferenced NULL in
   sock_eq.

   This test reproduces the crash:
     1. perform a name lookup so __res_context_send populates
        _u._ext.nsaddrs[] and sets _u._ext.nscount;
     2. drop RLIMIT_NOFILE so fopen("/etc/resolv.conf") fails with
        EMFILE on the next call;
     3. call res_init, which must report failure;
     4. perform another name lookup, which must not crash.  */
