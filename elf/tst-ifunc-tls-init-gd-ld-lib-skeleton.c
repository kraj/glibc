/* Unlike tst-ifunc-tls-init-lib-skeleton.c, which uses initial-exec and
   resolves via a single TP-relative load, this skeleton's TLS_MODEL is
   either "global-dynamic" or "local-dynamic" so the resolver's read of
   'sentinel' must traverse __tls_get_addr (or the architecture's
   TLSDESC equivalent).  That dynamic-TLS access can lazily allocate a
   per-module TLS block, which is the path being exercised.  */
