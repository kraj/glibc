/* Checks if a IFUNC resolver sees if a TLS blocker is properly initialized.
   The tst-ifunc-tls-init-lib.so carries:

   - a thread-local 'sentinel' initialised to SENTINEL.
   - an IFUNC 'ifunc_tls' whose resolver picks impl_ok when sentinel reads
     as SENTINEL and impl_bad (returning 0) otherwise.
   - an IFUNC-backed function-pointer global 'fptr' whose initialiser
     produces a non-PLT relocation.  */
